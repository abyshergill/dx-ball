## 🕹️ What is DX-Ball?

**DX-Ball** is a legendary PC brick-breaker game originally released in 1996 by Michael P. Welch. Heavily inspired by the classic arcade game *Arkanoid*, DX-Ball became an instant classic and a staple of late-90s shareware gaming due to its smooth gameplay, vibrant presentation, and iconic power-ups (like paddle extension, lasers, and multi-ball split).

*DX-Ball Level Edition* is a modern, web-native homage to that classic era, blending the beloved gameplay loop of the 1996 original with contemporary neon aesthetics, smooth canvas rendering, and responsive touch controls for modern devices.

## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Level Packs:** Includes 3 pre-configured maps with increasing complexity inspired by classic layouts (Checkered Field, Space Invader, and Neon Castle).
* **Multi-Hit Brick Durability:** Bricks require up to 3 distinct impacts to shatter, shifting color profiles as their structural integrity depletes.
* **Active Modifiers (Power-Ups):**
* `E` **Expand Paddle:** Extends the paddle's structural width for enhanced screen coverage.
* `L` **Laser Cannons:** Mounts dual laser turrets to the paddle to aggressively destroy bricks from a distance.
* `P` **Extra Life:** Restores lost health pools to lengthen game sessions.


* **Dynamic Speed Adjustment:** Optional toggle system that gradually escalates velocity vectors over sustained brick chains.
* **Audio Synthesizer Engine:** Uses the native HTML5 Web Audio API to procedurally generate distinct sound frequencies on-the-fly without external asset dependencies.
* **Adaptive Theme Settings:** Clean light/dark modes that immediately re-map color tables for the workspace interface.
